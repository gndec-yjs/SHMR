## ðŸ“– Unit 1: Structural Health

### **Factors Affecting the Health of Structures**
Structural health is influenced by various factors, including:
- **Material Properties**: Strength, durability, and resistance to environmental conditions.
- **Environmental Factors**: Exposure to extreme temperatures, moisture, chemical attacks, and seismic activity.
- **Loading Conditions**: Dead loads, live loads, wind loads, and accidental loads affecting structural integrity.
- **Construction Practices**: Quality of workmanship, adherence to design codes, and use of appropriate materials.
- **Aging and Wear**: Deterioration over time due to fatigue, corrosion, and material degradation.
- **Foundation and Soil Conditions**: Differential settlements, soil erosion, and liquefaction affecting stability.

### **Causes of Distress in Structures**
Structural distress can be caused by multiple factors:
- **Material Deterioration**: Corrosion of steel reinforcement, alkali-silica reaction, and sulfate attack.
- **Design Deficiencies**: Poor structural design, inadequate reinforcement, and improper load distribution.
- **Construction Defects**: Poor workmanship, improper curing, and deviations from specifications.
- **Overloading**: Exceeding the design load limits, leading to structural cracks and failures.
- **Environmental Effects**: Freeze-thaw cycles, seismic activity, and flooding.
- **Improper Maintenance**: Lack of periodic inspections, repairs, and protection measures.

### **Regular Maintenance of Structures**
To ensure longevity and performance, regular maintenance strategies include:
- **Preventive Maintenance**: Routine inspections, cleaning, and protective coatings.
- **Corrective Maintenance**: Repairing minor damages before they escalate into major failures.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Using monitoring techniques to detect potential failures before they occur.
- **Strengthening Measures**: Adding reinforcements, retrofitting techniques, and protective treatments.
- **Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)**: Implementing sensors and real-time monitoring systems to detect anomalies.
