# Static Field Testing

## 1. Introduction to Static Field Testing  
Static field testing involves applying controlled loads to a structure and measuring its response to assess its performance, safety, and serviceability. It helps in evaluating structural integrity, identifying defects, and verifying design assumptions. Unlike dynamic testing, which involves varying loads over time, static testing applies loads gradually and measures deflections, stresses, and strains under sustained conditions.

## 2. [Types of Static Tests](Types_of_Static_Tests.md)

### a) Load Testing  
- Used to assess the strength and serviceability of structural elements.  
- Load is applied gradually using weights, hydraulic jacks, or other controlled mechanisms.  
- Common in bridges, beams, slabs, and columns.  
- Deflections and deformations are measured to compare with theoretical values.  

### b) Proof Load Testing  
- A specific type of load testing where the structure is subjected to a load slightly above its design load.  
- Ensures the structure can sustain loads safely without excessive deflection or permanent damage.  

### c) Creep and Shrinkage Tests  
- Evaluates time-dependent deformations in concrete and other materials.  
- Load is applied over a prolonged period to measure slow deformation (creep).  
- Shrinkage is observed due to material properties, environmental factors, and curing conditions.  

### d) Load-Deformation Testing  
- Measures how a structure deforms under applied loads.  
- Used for structural elements like beams, columns, and slabs.  
- Stress-strain relationships and material properties can be determined.  

### e) Static Strength Testing  
- Determines ultimate strength and failure modes of structures or components.  
- Load is increased until failure to evaluate safety factors.

   - A numerical method used to simulate structural responses under loads.  
   - Helps predict stress distribution, deflection, and failure points.  

2. **Structural Modelling:**  
   - Physical models or computational models simulate real-life behavior.  
   - Used for bridges, buildings, and offshore structures.  

3. **Experimental vs. Theoretical Correlation:**  
   - Comparison of real test results with theoretical calculations.  
   - Helps in validating design assumptions and safety margins.
