# Static Response Measurement

## 1. Introduction
Static response measurement is a critical aspect of structural health monitoring, ensuring that buildings, bridges, and other infrastructures perform within safe limits under applied loads. This process involves assessing deformations, stresses, strains, and other structural behaviors when subjected to static loads. 

Static response measurement provides valuable data for evaluating the integrity, stability, and longevity of structures. It aids in validating design assumptions, identifying potential failures, and planning maintenance strategies.
